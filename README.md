# Fifa data from Kaggle to Blob storage connected by Databricks - A Spark project

I collected data from Kaggle repo at 12/12/22, before any world cup semifinal matches, just to analyse 
some of the best defenser and dangers players until now in the world cup. 

The conclusion was that Morocco and France has two players at the top 5 tackler in this stage of the championship.
And the most danger players are Mbappe and Messi, no suprise. But Purisic is even more danger. Purisic need 4 situation to score or assist while Mbappe and Messi need 5.
But is important to say that Croatia used to attack less than France or Argentina. 

Anyway my intention was find a nice dataset, I did, to pratice Spark on Databricks. And as a bonus I used Azure storage.
